# What format your data should be in

Machines do not like the following format:

Neither this:

Machines will prefer this:

ðŸ‘† More columns, the better. Machines do not like pivoted/aggregated\* data. Also, notice that there is no formatting/headers/coloring in a machine-friendly dataset. Also, no `Total` values or other aggregate values.

Gaps like the below image are good for humans, but not for machines:

Tableau has some provisions for data preparation for such kind of datasets.

# Data Interpreter

Download `PersonalVehicleSalesGlobal.xlsx` from Kirill's website.

The Excel file is very messy. You might have to do some key cleaning before importing the file to Tableau.

After cleaning, import it as a Data Source and then:

# Pivot

Our data is still not machine-optimized as there are seperate columns or years.

Use `Pivot` to do this:

Outcome:

[This](./markdown-linked-files/sec-0007-0022.pdf) is what ChatGPT had to say about the pivoting functionality in Tableau.

# Splitting a column into different columns

Example: extracting the last word from each row of the `Regions` column.

Example: you might want to split the first ame and the last name from the full name from a dataset in the future. This is why you Split.

Alternatively, you may split from the Worksheet:

# Metadata grid

Rename columns, and delete the last column:

Build this:

# Fixing geographical data errors

Create the following map:

There are errors due to spelling mistakes:

Fix them and click OK.
